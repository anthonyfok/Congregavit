{\centering Let us pray.\par}

\lettrine{O}{ Lord} Jesus Christ, Who hast said: Ask, and ye shall receive; seek,
and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you; grant, we
beseech Thee, to us who ask the gift of Thy most divine love, that we
may ever love Thee with all our hearts, and in all our words and
actions, and never cease praising Thee. 

Give us, O Lord, a perpetual
fear and love of Thy holy name; for Thou never failest to govern those
whom Thou dost solidly establish in Thy love. Who livest and reignest,
world without end.    
\Rbar Amen.
