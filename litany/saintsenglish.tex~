\lettrine{A}{lmighty,} and everlasting God, Who hast dominion over the living and
the dead, and art merciful to all whom Thou foreknowest shall be
Thine, by faith and good works; we humbly beseech Thee, that they for
whom we intend to pour forth our prayers, whether this present world
still detain them in the flesh, or the world to come hath already
received them out of their bodies, may, through the intercession of
all Thy Saints, by the clemency of Thy goodness, obtain the remission
of all their sins. Through our lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who liveth
and reigneth with Thee in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God world without end.
\Rbar Amen.
