\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\begin{altverse}
\FirstVerse{O}{ Jesus} Christ remember\\*
when Thou shalt come again\\*
Upon the clouds of heaven\\*
with all Thy shining train\\
When every eye shall see Thee\\*
in deity revealed\\*
Who now upon this altar\\*
in silence art concealed.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{2}Remember then O Saviour\\*
I supplicate of Thee\\*
That here I bowed before Thee\\*
upon my bended knee\\
That here I owned Thy presence\\*
and did not Thee deny\\*
And glorified Thy greatness\\*
though hid from human eye.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{3}Accept divine Redeemer\\*
the homage of my praise\\*
Be Thou the light and honour\\*
and glory of my days\\
Be Thou my consolation\\*
when death is drawing nigh\\*
Be Thou my only treasure\\*
through all eternity.
\end{altverse}

\end{verse}
