\FirstLine{Come to Me all ye who labour}

\FirstVerse{``C}{ome} to Me all ye who labour, \\*
Come and I will give you rest.''\\
Such, dear Lord, Thine invitation \\*
To each soul become Thy guest;\\
And we answer, with deep longing,\\*
While our sinfulness we see,\\
``Jesus, Lord, I am not worthy,\\*
Yet in pity come to me.''

\flagverse{2} Here upon this altar lowly,\\*
Is the home Thou lovest most,\\
And we own our Lord and Master\\*
Hidden in the sacred Host;\\
Life without Thee would be lonely,\\*
And our hearts still cry to Thee,\\
``Jesus, Lord, I am not worthy,\\*
Yet in pity come to me.''

\flagverse{3} All is joy when Thou art near us,\\*
Earth can never bliss impart,\\
Like the peace and heav'nly sweetness\\*
Of Thy visit to each heart;\\
All unfelt are grief and sorrow,\\*
As with trust we cry to Thee,\\
``Jesus, Lord, I am not worthy,\\*
Yet in pity come to me.''

\end{verse}
