\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\FirstVerse{T}{he Word} of God proceeding forth,\\*
Yet leaving not the Father's side,\\*   
And going to His work on earth,      \\* 
Had reached at length life's           
  eventide.

\flagverse{2}By a disciple to be given              \\*
To rivals, for His Blood athirst,      \\*
Himself, the very Bread of             
  heaven,                              \\*
He gave to His disciples first.        

\flagverse{3}He gave Himself in either kind,        \\*
His precious Flesh, His precious       
  Blood;                               \\*
Of flesh and blood is man combin'd,    \\*
And He of man would be the food.       

\flagverse{4}In birth, Himself as friend He gave,   \\*
At table, food and drink became,       \\*
In death, our ransom from the          
  grave,                               \\*
In reigning, our prize to attain.

\flagverse{5}O saving Victim, op'ning wide          \\*
The gate of heav'n to man below!       \\*
Our foes press on from ev'ry side:     \\*
Thine aid supply, Thy strength         
  bestow.                              

\flagverse{6}To Thy great name be endless           
  praise,                              \\*
Immortal Godhead, One in Three!        \\*
O grant us endless length of days      \\*
In our true native land, with Thee.    
Amen.
