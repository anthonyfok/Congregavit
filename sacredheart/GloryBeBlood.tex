\FirstVerse{G}{lory} be to Jesus,\\*
Who in bitter pains\\*
Pour'd for me the life-\\
\qquad blood\\*
From His sacred veins.

\flagverse{2} Grace and life eternal\\*
In that Blood I find:\\*
Blest be His compassion,\\*
Infinitely kind.

\flagverse{3} Blest through endless ages\\*
Be the precious stream.\\*
Which from endless\\
\qquad torment\\*
Doth the world redeem. 

\flagverse{4} There the fainting spirit\\*
Drinks of life her fill;\\*
There as in a fountain\\*
Laves herself at will. 

\flagverse{5} Abel's blood for\\
\qquad vengeance\\*
Pleaded to the skies;\\*
But the Blood of Jesus\\*
For our pardon cries. 

\flagverse{6} Oft as it is sprinkled\\*
On our guilty hearts,\\* 
Satan in confusion\\*
Terror-struck departs. 

\flagverse{7} Oft as earth exalting\\*
Wafts its praise on high,\\*
Hell with horror\\
\qquad trembles;\\*
Heav'n is fill'd with joy. 

\flagverse{8} Lift ye, then, your voices;\\*
Swell the mighty flood;\\*
Louder still and louder,\\*
Praise the precious Blood.
