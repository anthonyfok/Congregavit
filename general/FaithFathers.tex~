\FirstLine{Faith of our Fathers, living still}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\begin{altverse}
\FirstVerse{F}{aith} of our fathers, living still\\*
In spite of dungeon, fire and sword:\\*
O how our hearts beat high with joy\\*
Whene'er we hear that glorious word.
\end{altverse}

\flagverse{Chorus:}Faith of our fathers, Holy Faith,\\*
We will be true to thee till death.

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{2}Our fathers, chained in prison dark,\\*
Were still in heart and conscience free:\\*
How sweet would be their children's fate,\\*
If they, like them, could die for thee.
\end{altverse}
						
\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{3}Faith of our fathers, Mary's prayers\\*
Shall win our country back to thee:\\*
    And through the truth that comes from God\\*
        This land shall then indeed be free.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{4}Faith of our Fathers, we will love\\*
        Both friend and foe in all our strife:\\*
    And preach thee too, as love knows how\\*
        By kindly words and virtuous life:
\end{altverse}
