\FirstLine{Make me a channel of Your peace}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\FirstVerse{M}{ake} me a channel of your peace.\\*
Where there is hatred, let me bring your love.\\
Where there is injury, your pardon, Lord.\\*
And where there’s doubt, true faith in you.

\flagverse{2} Make me a channel of your peace.\\*
Where there’s despair in life, let me bring hope.\\
Where there is darkness- only light,\\*
And where there’s sadness, ever joy.

\begin{indentedVerse}
\vin Oh, Master, grant that I may never seek\\*
\vin So much to be consoled as to console.\\
\vin To be understood as to understand.\\*
\vin To be loved, as to love with all my soul.
\end{indentedVerse}

\flagverse{3} Make me a channel of your peace.\\*
It is in pardoning that we are pardoned.\\
In giving to all men that we receive,\\*
And in dying that we’re born to eternal life.

\end{verse}
