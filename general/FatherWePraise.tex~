\flagverse{1} Now to Your altar, in answer
 to Your call,\\
We come to give thanks to You
 and praise You. 

\flagverse{2}Send forth the light of Your truth
 to be our guide\\
And show us the way to our eternal home. 

\flagverse{3} Lord, we are sinners, unworthy 
of Your love,\\
And You are the Father who can pardon us.

\flagverse{4} Mary our mother, and all you saints of God,\\
Remember us, pray for us 
Before His throne.
