\begin{indentedVerse}
\flagverse{Antiphon}\initialV{W}{here} there is charity and love,\\*
There the God of love abides.
\end{indentedVerse}

\flagverse{1}The love of Christ has gathered 
us as one;\\*
Rejoice in Him with joy which he   
imparts;\\
Let us revere and love the living   
God,\\*
And love each other with   
unfeigning hearts.

\flagverse{2}And so, when we are gathered
here as one,\\*
Let quarrels die, and envious  
rancor cease;\\
Be our resolve all bitterness to    
shun,\\*
And in our midst be Christ, His 
love and peace.

\flagverse{3} O lead us Master, by Your 
saving grace,\\*
To where the Blessed glory in 
Your sight;\\
There let us see and love You,  
face to face,\\*
Gathered once more in 
everlasting light.


\end{verse}
