\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\FirstVerse{P}{raise} the Lord! Ye heavens adore him\\*
Praise him angels in the height;\\*
Sun and moon rejoice before him;\\*
Praise him all ye stars of light.\\*
Praise the Lord for he hath spoken;\\*
Worlds his mighty voice obeyed;\\*
Laws which never shall be broken\\*
For their guidance he hath made.

\flagverse{2}Praise the Lord! For he is glorious;\\*
Never shall  his promise fail;\\*
God has made his saints victorious; \\*
Sin and death shall not prevail.\\*
Praise the God of our salvation!\\*
Hosts on high, his pow?r proclaim;\\
Heaven and earth, and all creation,\\*
Laud and magnify his name.
