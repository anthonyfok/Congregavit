\FirstLine{Now thank we all our God}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\begin{altverse}
\FirstVerse{N}{ow} thank we all our God,\\*
With heart and mind and voices,\\*
Who wondrous things hath done,\\*
In whom His world rejoices;\\*
Who from our mother's arms\\*
Hath blessed us on our way\\*
With countless gifts of love,\\*
And still is ours today.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{2}Oh, may this bounteous God\\*
Through all our life be near us,\\*
With ever joyful hearts\\*
And blessed peace to cheer us;\\*
And keep us in His grace,\\*
And guide us when perplexed,\\*
And free us from all ills\\*
In this world and the next.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{3}All praise and thanks to God\\*
The Father now be given,\\*
The Son, and Him who reigns\\*
With them in highest heaven,\\*
Eternal Three in One\\*
Whom earth and heaven adore;\\*
For thus it was, is now,\\*
And shall be ever more.
\end{altverse}
