\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\FirstVerse{P}{raise} to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of Creation!\\*
O my soul praise Him, for He is your health and salvation.\\*
All you who hear, now to His altar draw near,\\*
Join in profound adoration.

\flagverse{2}Praise to the Lord, let us offer our gifts at His altar;\\*
Let not our sins and transgressions now cause us to falter.\\*
Christ the High-Priest bids us all join in His feast,\\*
Victims with Him on the altar.

\flagverse{3}Praise to the Lord, who will prosper our work and defend us;\\*
Surely His goodness and mercy here daily attend us;\\*
Ponder anew all the Almighty can do,\\*
He who with love will befriend us.

\flagverse{4}Praise to the Lord, oh, let all that is in us adore Him!\\*
All that has life and breath, come now in praises before Him.\\*
Let the Amen sound from His people again,\\*
Now as we worship before Him.
