\FirstLine{O God of earth and altar}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\begin{altverse}
\FirstVerse{O}{ God} of earth and altar,\\*
Bow down and hear our cry,\\
Our earthly rulers falter,\\*
Our people drift and die;\\
The walls of gold entomb us,\\*
The swords of scorn divide,\\
Take not Thy thunder from us,\\*
But take away our pride.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{2}From all that terror teaches,\\*
From lies of tongue and pen,\\
From all the easy speeches\\*
That comfort cruel men,\\
From sale and profanation\\*
Of honour and the sword,\\
From sleep and from damnation,\\*
Deliver us, good Lord!
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{3}Tie in a living tether\\*
The prince and priest and thrall,\\
Bind all our lives together,\\*
Smite us and save us all;\\
In ire and exaltation,\\*
Aflame with faith, and free,\\
Lift up a living nation,\\*
A single sword to Thee.
\end{altverse}

\end{verse}
