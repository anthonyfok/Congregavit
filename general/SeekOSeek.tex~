\flagverse{1}God, be with us in our lives,\\*
Direct us in our calling;\\
Break the snares the world contrives,\\*
Keep us from falling.

\flagverse{Refrain}Seek, O seek the Lord, while he is near;\\*
trust him, speak to him in prayer,\\*
and he will hear.

\flagverse{2}God, increase in us the life\\*
That Christ by dying gave us:\\
Though we faint in mortal strife\\*
His blood will save us.

\flagverse{3}Strengthen in our hearts the love\\*
We owe to one another;\\
How can we love God above\\*
And not our brother?

\end{verse}
