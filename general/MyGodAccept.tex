\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\begin{altverse}
\FirstVerse{M}{y God,} accept my heart this day\\*
        And make it always Thine\\
        That I from Thee no more may stray,\\*
        No more from Thee decline.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{2} Before the cross of Him who died,\\*
        Behold, I prostrate fall;\\
        Let every sin be crucified\\*
        And Christ be All in all.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{3} Anoint me with Thy Spirit's grace\\*
        And seal me for Thine own\\
        That I may see Thy glorious face\\*
        And worship near Thy throne.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{4} May the dear blood once shed for me\\*
        My blest atonement prove\\
        That I from first to last may be\\*
        The purchase of Thy love!
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{5} Let every thought and work and word\\*
        To Thee be ever given;\\
        Then life shall be Thy service, Lord,\\*
        And death the gate of heaven.
\end{altverse}
