\begin{altverse}
\FirstVerse{P}{raise,} my soul, the King of heaven;\\*
To His feet Thy tribute bring;\\*
Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,\\*
Evermore His praises sing:\\*
Alleluia, alleluia!\\*
Praise the everlasting King.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{2}Praise Him for His grace and favour\\*
To our fathers in distress;\\*
Praise Him still the same for ever,\\*
Slow to chide and swift to bless:\\*
Alleluia, alleluia!\\*
Glorious in His faithfulness.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{3}Father-like, He tends and spares us;\\*
Well our feeble frame He knows;\\*
In His hand He gently bears us, \\*
Rescues us from all our foes.\\*
Alleluia, alleluia!\\*
Widely yet His mercy flows.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{4}Angels, help us to adore Him;\\*
Ye behold Him face to face;\\*
Sun and moon, bow down before Him,\\*
Dwellers all in time and space.\\*
Alleluia, alleluia!\\*
Praise with us the God of grace. 
\end{altverse}
