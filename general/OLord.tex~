\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\FirstVerse{O}{ Lord} my God! When I, in awesome wonder\\*
Consider all the works Thy hand hath made,\\*
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,\\*
Thy pow'r throughout the universe displayed.

\begin{indentedVerse}
\flagverse{Chorus}\vin Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee.\\*
\vin How great Thou art, how great Thou art,\\*
\vin Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee.\\*
\vin How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
\end{indentedVerse}

\flagverse{2}When through the woods and forest glades I wander\\*
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;\\*
When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur\\*
And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze

\flagverse{3}And when I think that God his Son not sparing,\\*
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;\\*
That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing \\*
He bled and died to take away my sin.

\flagverse{4}When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation\\*
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart,\\*
Then I shall bow in humble adoration \\*
And there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art!

\end{verse}
