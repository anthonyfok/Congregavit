\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\FirstVerse{C}{hrist} is made the sure foundation,\\*
Christ the head and cornerstone,\\
Chosen of the Lord, and precious,\\*
Binding all the Church in one;\\
Holy Zion's help for ever,\\*
And her confidence alone.

\flagverse{2}All that dedicated city,\\*
Dearly loved of God on high,\\
In exultant jubilation\\*
Pours perpetual melody;\\
God the One in Three adoring\\*
In glad hymns eternally.

\flagverse{3}To this temple, where we call Thee,\\*
Come, O Lord of Hosts, today;\\
With Thy wonted loving-kindness\\*
Hear Thy servants as they pray,\\
And Thy fullest benediction\\*
Shed within its walls alway.

\flagverse{4}Here vouchsafe to all Thy servants\\*
What they ask of Thee of gain;\\
What they gain from Thee, for ever\\*
With the bless√®d to retain,\\
And hereafter in Thy glory\\*
Evermore with Thee to reign.

\flagverse{5}Laud and honour to the Father,\\*
Laud and honour to the Son,\\
Laud and honour to the Spirit,\\*
Ever Three, and ever One,\\
Consubstantial, co-eternal,\\*
While unending ages run.

\end{verse}
