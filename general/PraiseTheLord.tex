\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\FirstVerse{P}{raise} the Lord! Ye heavens adore Him\\*
Praise Him angels in the height;\\
Sun and moon rejoice before Him;\\*
Praise Him all ye stars of light.\\
Praise the Lord for He hath spoken;\\*
Worlds His mighty voice obeyed;\\
Laws which never shall be broken\\*
For their guidance He hath made.

\flagverse{2}Praise the Lord! For He is glorious;\\*
Never shall  His promise fail;\\
God has made His saints victorious; \\*
Sin and death shall not prevail.\\
Praise the God of our salvation!\\*
Hosts on high, His pow'r proclaim;\\
Heaven and earth, and all creation,\\*
Laud and magnify His name.
