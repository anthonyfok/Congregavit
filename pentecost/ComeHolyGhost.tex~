\FirstVerse{C}{ome,} Holy Ghost, Creator, come\\*
From thy bright heavenly throne,\\*
Come, take possession of our souls,\\*
And make them all thine own.
\pointorig

\flagverse{2}Thou who art called the Paraclete,\\*
Best gift of God above,\\*
The living spring, the living fire,\\*
Sweet unction and true love.

\flagverse{3}Thou who art sev'nfold in thy grace,\\*
Finger of God's right hand;\\*
His promise, teaching little ones\\*
To speak and understand.

\flagverse{4}O guide our minds with thy blest light,\\*
With love our hearts inflame;\\*
And with thy strength, which ne'er decays,\\*
Confirm our mortal frame.

\flagverse{5}Far from us drive our deadly foe;\\*
True peace unto us bring;\\*
And through all perils lead us safe\\*
Beneath thy sacred wing.

\flagverse{6}Through thee may we the Father know,\\*
Through thee th'eternal Son,\\*
And thee the Spirit of them both,\\*
Thrice-blessed Three in One.

\flagverse{7}All glory to the Father be,\\*
With his co-equal Son:\\*
The same to thee, great Paraclete,\\*
While endless ages run.
