%For the Ascension
%From St Dominics hymnbook

Thy sacred race, O Lord, is run,\\*
Thy work is wrought, thy victory won;
The glory Thou didst leave requires
Thy presence in supernal choirs
The clouds Thy chariot, earth afar
Beneath Thy feet a little star;
Ten thousand thousand angels sing,
To welcome their returning King.

The gates of heaven obey the call,
And open to the Lord of all;
His throne receives the eternal Son,
Both God and Man for ever one.
Thou mediator and high priest,
Fresh from the sacrifice released,
By love constrained dost hither bring
Thy smitten heart's best offering.

And she who from Thy opened side
Her being took, Thy holy Bride,
Still nourished from Thy side survives,
And life and all from Thee derives.
Hence in the thickest of the fight,
Thy warriors win their heavenly might;
And hence, Thy martyrs sing their psalms
And joyous wave triumphal palms.

Where Thou, the head, art gone, Thy voice
Calls all Thy members to rejoice;
Ah, let them cleave the shining way,
Thy footprints through the ether fray.
To Thee be glory, conquering King,
Who unto heaven Thy way dost wing,
Great Son of the eternal Sire,
Whose Spirit is our one desire.
