\FirstLine{Once in royal David's city}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\FirstVerse{O}{nce} in royal David's city\\*
            Stood a lowly cattle shed,\\*
            Where a mother laid her baby\\*
            In a manger for His bed;\\
Mary was that mother mild,\\*
Jesus Christ her little child.

\flagverse{2}He came down to earth from heaven,\\*
Who is God and Lord of all,\\*
And His shelter was a stable,\\*
And His cradle was a stall;\\
With the poor and mean and lowly,\\*
Lived on earth our Saviour holy.

\flagverse{3}And, through all His wond'rous childhood,\\*
He would honour and obey,\\*
Love and watch the lowly maiden\\*
In whose gentle arms He lay:\\
Christian children all must be\\*
Mild, obedient, good as He.

\flagverse{4}For He is our childhood's pattern,\\*
Day by day like us He grew;\\*
He was little, weak and helpless,\\*
Tears and smiles like us He knew.\\
And He feeleth for our sadness,\\*
And He shareth in our gladness.

\flagverse{5}And our eyes at last shall see Him,\\*
Through His own redeeming love;\\*
For that Child who seemed so helpless\\*
Is our Lord in heaven above;\\
And He leads His children on\\*
To the place where He is gone.

\flagverse{6}Not in that poor lowly stable,\\*
With the oxen standing round,\\*
We shall see Him; but in heaven,\\*
Set at God's right hand on high;\\
When like stars His children crowned,\\*
All in white shall wait around.



\end{verse}
