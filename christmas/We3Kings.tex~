\FirstLine{We three kings of Orient are}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\FirstVerse{W}{e} three kings of Orient are,\\*
Bearing gifts we travel afar\\
Field and fountain, moor and mountain,\\*
Following yonder star.

\flagverse{Chorus}O star of wonder, star of night,\\*
Star with royal beauty bright,\\
Westward leading, still proceeding,\\*
Guide us to the perfect Light.

\flagverse{2}Born a babe on Bethlehem's plain,\\*
Gold we bring to crown Him again;\\
King forever, ceasing never,\\*
Over us all to reign.

\flagverse{3}Frankincense to offer have I;\\*
Incense owns a Deity nigh,\\
Prayer and praising all men raising,\\*
Worship Him God most high.

\flagverse{4}Myrrh is mine: its bitter perfume\\*
Breathes a life of gathering gloom;\\
Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding dying,\\*
Sealed in the stone cold tomb.

\flagverse{5}Glorious now behold Him arise,\\*
King and God and Sacrifice:\\
Heav'n sings, ``Alleluia!''\\*
``Alleluia!'' the earth replies.

\end{verse}
