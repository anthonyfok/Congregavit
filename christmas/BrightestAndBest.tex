\FirstLine{Brightest and best of the sons of the morning}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\begin{altverse}
\FirstVerse{B}{rightest} and best of the sons of the morning,\\*
Dawn on our darkness, and lend us thine aid!\\
Star of the East, the horizon adorning,\\*
Guide where our infant Redeemer is laid!
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{2}Cold on His cradle the dew-drops are shining;\\*
Low lies His head with the beasts of the stall;\\
Angels adore Him in slumber reclining,\\*
Maker and Monarch and Saviour of all.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{3}Say, shall we yield Him, in costly devotion,\\*
Odours of Edom, and offerings divine,\\
Gems of the mountains, and pearls of the ocean,\\*
Myrrh from the forest, or gold from the mine?
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{4}Vainly we offer each ample oblation,\\*
Vainly with gifts would His favour secure:\\
Richer by far is the heart's adoration,\\*
Dearer to God are the prayers of the poor.
\end{altverse}

\end{verse}
