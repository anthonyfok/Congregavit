\begin{patverse}
\FirstVerse{T}{he} first Nowell, the angels did say\\*
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay\\*
   In fields where they lay keeping their sheep\\*
    On a cold winter's night that was so deep.\\*
              Nowell, Nowell, Nowell, Nowell\\*
            Born is the King of Israel!
\end{patverse}

\begin{patverse}
\flagverse{2}They looked up and saw a star\\*
        Shining in the East beyond them far\\
       And to the earth it gave great light\\*
      And so it continued both day and night.\\
              Nowell, Nowell, Nowell, Nowell\\*
            Born is the King of Israel!
\end{patverse}

\begin{patverse}
\flagverse{3}And by the light of that same star\\*
       Three Wise men came from country far\\
        To seek for a King was their intent\\*
     And to follow the star wherever it went.\\
              Nowell, Nowell, Nowell, Nowell\\*
            Born is the King of Israel!
\end{patverse}

\begin{patverse}
\flagverse{4}This star drew nigh to the northwest\\*
          O'er Bethlehem it took its rest\\
	  And there it did both stop and stay\\*
       Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.\\
              Nowell, Nowell, Nowell, Nowell\\*
            Born is the King of Israel!
\end{patverse}

\begin{patverse}
\flagverse{5}Then entered in those Wise men three\\*
          Full rev'rently upon their knee,\\
         And offered there, in His presence\\*
      Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.\\
              Nowell, Nowell, Nowell, Nowell\\*
           Born is the King of Israel!
\end{patverse}

\begin{patverse}
\flagverse{6}Then let us all with one accord\\*
         Sing praises to our heavenly Lord\\
     That hath made Heaven and earth of nought\\*
      And with His blood mankind has bought.\\
              Nowell, Nowell, Nowell, Nowell\\*
            Born is the King of Israel!
\end{patverse}
	    
\end{verse}
