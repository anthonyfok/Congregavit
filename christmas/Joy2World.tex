\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\FirstVerse{J}{oy} to the world, the Lord is come!\\*
Let earth receive her King;\\
Let every heart prepare Him room,\\*
And Heaven and nature sing,\\
And Heaven and nature sing,\\
And Heaven, and Heaven and nature sing.

\flagverse{2}Joy to the earth, the Saviour reigns!\\*
Let men their songs employ;\\
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains\\*
Repeat the sounding joy,\\
Repeat the sounding joy,\\
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.

\flagverse{3}No more let sins and sorrows grow,\\*
Nor thorns infest the ground;\\
He comes to make His blessings flow\\*
Far as the curse is found,\\
Far as the curse is found,\\
Far as, far as the curse is found.

\flagverse{4}He rules the world with truth and grace,\\*
And makes the nations prove\\
The glories of His righteousness,\\*
And wonders of His love,\\
And wonders of His love,\\
And wonders, wonders of His love.
