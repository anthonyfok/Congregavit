\flagverse{2}God from God, Light from Light\\*
Lo, He abhors not the Virgin's womb,\\*
Very God begotten, not created:

\flagverse{3}The splendour eternal of eternal Godhead\\*
Veiled with infirmities of flesh we see:\\*
Hiding His glory, swaddling clothes He weareth: 

\flagverse{4} Sing choirs of angels, sing in exultation,\\*
Sing, all ye citizens of heaven above;\\*
Glory to God; glory in the highest:

\flagverse{5} Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, born this happy morning;\\*
Jesu, to Thee be glory giv'n;\\*
Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing.

\end{verse}
