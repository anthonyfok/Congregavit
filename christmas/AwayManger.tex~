\FirstLine{Away in a manger}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\FirstVerse{A}{way} in a manger\\*
   No crib for a bed\\
   The little Lord Jesus\\*
   Laid down His sweet head.\\
   The stars in the bright sky\\*
   Looked down where He lay\\
   The little Lord Jesus\\*
   Asleep on the hay.
    
\flagverse{2}The cattle are lowing\\*
   The baby awakes\\
   But little Lord Jesus\\*
   No crying He makes.\\
   I love thee, Lord Jesus\\*
   Look down from the sky\\
   And stay by my bedside\\*
   Til morning is nigh.
    
\flagverse{3}Be near me, Lord Jesus;\\*
   I ask thee to stay\\
   Close by me for ever,\\*
   And love me I pray.\\
   Bless all the dear children\\*
   In Thy tender care\\
   And take us to heaven\\*
   To live with Thee there.

\end{verse}
