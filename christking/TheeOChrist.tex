\FirstLine{Thee, O Christ, the Prince of ages}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\FirstVerse{T}{hee,} O Christ, the Prince of ages,\\*
Thee the nation's glorious King,\\*
Praise we now with exultation \\*
Men and angels answering,\\
And to Thee with meek devotion\\*
Hearts and minds and senses bring.

\flagverse{2}Come, O Lord, assume Thy Kingship\\*
Rebel hearts Thy pow'r can gain;\\
Bend the stubborn will of rulers,\\*
Who from homage still refrain;\\
In the home as in the city\\*
Be supreme, O Christ, and reign.

\flagverse{3}From our own dear land, Australia,\\*
Drive the night of heresy\\
That, in holy Church united,\\*
All may love and worship Thee: \\
Who, upon the Cross uplifted\\*
Draws mankind in Charity.

\end{verse}
