Our glad voices telling\\*
The praise of the loveliest Rose of the vale.

Queen of the Angels \\*

\flagverse{2} Our voices ascending\\*
In harmony blending,\\*
O thus may our hearts turn, dear Mother to thee.\\
O thus shall we prove thee,\\*
How truly we love thee,\\*
How dark without Mary, life's journey would be.
