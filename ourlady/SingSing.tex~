\FirstLine{Sing, sing, ye Angel Bands}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\begin{altverse}
\FirstVerse{S}{ing,} sing, ye Angel Bands,\\*
All beautiful and bright;\\
For higher still and higher,\\*
Through fields of starry light,\\
Mary, your Queen, ascends,\\*
Like the sweet moon at night.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{2}A fairer flower than she\\*
On earth hath never been;\\
And, save the Throne of God,\\*
Your Heavens have never seen\\
A wonder half so bright\\*
As your ascending Queen!
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{3}And shall I lose thee then,\\*
Lose my sweet right to thee,\\
Ah, no---the Angels' Queen\\*
Man's Mother still will be,\\
And thou upon thy throne\\*
Wilt keep thy love for me.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{4}See! see! the Eternal Hands\\*
Put on her radiant crown,\\
And the sweet Majesty\\*
Of Mercy sitteth down,\\
For ever and for aye\\*
On her predestined throne!
\end{altverse}


\end{verse}
