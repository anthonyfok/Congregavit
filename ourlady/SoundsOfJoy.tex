\FirstVerse{S}{ounds} of joy have put to flight\\
All the sadness of the night:\\
Now a maid beyond compare\\
Hears her praises fill the air:\\
~ \quad Virgo María.

\flagverse{2}Who with glad and joyful sighs,\\
When the Lord from death did rise,\\
Flowered as the lily bloom,\\
Seeing Son His life resume:\\
\ \quad Virgo María.

\flagverse{3}Who is she whom angels sing,\\
Making all creation ring?\\
She it is who wins our praise,\\
As on earth our voice we raise:\\
\ \quad Virgo María.

\flagverse{4}Queen of virgins, Maiden mild,\\
Hear me, take me for your child.\\
Ever my protector be;\\
Bring eternal life to me:\\
\ \quad Virgo María.

\flagverse{5}Mighty Godhead, Three in One,\\
While eternal ages run,\\
Look to Mary, full of grace,\\
And forgive the human race:\\
\ \quad Virgo María.

\end{verse}
