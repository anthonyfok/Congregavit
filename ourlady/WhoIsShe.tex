\begin{altverse}
\FirstVerse{W}{ho} is she ascends so high\\*
Next the heavenly King\\
Round about whom angels fly\\*
And her praises sing?
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{2}Who is she adorned with light\\*
Makes the sun her robe\\
At whose feet the queen of night\\*
Lays her changing globe?
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{3}This is she in whose pure womb\\*
Heaven's Prince remained;\\
Therefore in no earthly tomb\\*
Can she be contained.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{4}Heaven she was, which held that fire\\*
Whence the world took light\\
And to heaven doth now aspire\\*
Flames with flames t'unite.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{5}She that did so clearly shine\\*
When our day begun,\\
See how bright her beams decline:\\*
Now she sits with th' Son.
\end{altverse}
