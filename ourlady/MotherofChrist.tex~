\FirstVerse
Mother of Christ, Mother of Christ
What shall I ask of thee?
I do not sigh for the wealth of earth,
For the joys that fade and flee,
But Mother of Christ, Mother of Christ,
This do I long to see,
The bliss untold which thine arms enfold, 
The treasure upon thy knee.

2. Mother of Christ, Mother of Christ,
I toss on a stormy sea,
O, lift thy Child as a beacon-light
To the port where I fain would be.
And, Mother of Christ, Mother of Christ,
This do I ask of thee;
When the voyage is o?er, O! stand on the shore,
And show Him at last to me.



\end{verse}
