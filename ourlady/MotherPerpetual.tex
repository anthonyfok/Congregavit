\FirstLine{Mary from thy sacred image}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\FirstVerse{M}{ary} from thy sacred image,\\*
With thine eyes so sadly sweet,\\
Mother of Perpetual Succour,\\*
See us kneeling at thy feet.\\
In thine arms thy Child thou bearest,\\*
Source of all thy joy and woe;\\
What thy bliss, how deep thy sorrows,\\*
Mother, thou alone canst know.

\flagverse{2} On thy face He is not gazing,\\*
Nor on us is turned His glance;\\
For His anxious look He fixes,\\*
On the cross and reed and lance.\\
To thy hand His hands are clinging,\\*
As a child would cling in fear,\\
Of that vision of the torments,\\*
Of His Passion drawing near.

\flagverse{3} And for Him thine eyes are pleading,\\*
While to us they look and cry:\\
`Sinners, see my Child, your Saviour,\\*
Who for love of you will die.'\\
Yes, we hear thy words, sweet Mother,\\*
But, poor sinners, we are weak;\\
At thy feet thy helpless children\\*
Thy perpetual succour seek.

\flagverse{4} Succour us, when stormy passions\\*
Sudden rise within the heart;\\
Quell the tempest, calm the billows,\\*
Peace  secure to us impart.\\
Through this life of weary exile\\*
Succour us in every need;\\
And when death shall come to free us,\\*
Succour us, ah then, indeed. 

\end{verse}
