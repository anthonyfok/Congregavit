\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\begin{altverse}
\FirstVerse{M}{other} of Christ, Mother of Christ\\*
What shall I ask of thee?\\
I do not sigh for the wealth of earth,\\*
For the joys that fade and flee,\\
But Mother of Christ, Mother of Christ,\\*
This do I long to see,\\
The bliss untold which thine arms enfold, \\*
The treasure upon thy knee.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{2} Mother of Christ, Mother of Christ,\\*
I toss on a stormy sea,\\
O, lift thy Child as a beacon-light\\*
To the port where I fain would be.\\
And, Mother of Christ, Mother of Christ,\\*
This do I ask of thee;\\
When the voyage is o'er, O! stand on the shore,\\*
And show Him at last to me.
\end{altverse}
