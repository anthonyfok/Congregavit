\FirstLine{Daily, daily sing to Mary}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\FirstVerse{D}{aily,} daily sing to Mary,\\*
Sing my soul, her praises due;\\
All her feasts, her actions worship,\\*
With the heart's devotion true.\\
Lost in wondering contemplation\\*
Be her majesty confessed;\\
Call her Mother, call her Virgin,\\*
Happy mother, Virgin blest.

\flagverse{2} She is mighty to deliver,\\*
Call her, trust her lovingly,\\
When the tempest rages round thee\\*
She will calm the troubled sea.\\
Gifts of heaven she has given,\\*
Noble Lady to our race,\\
She the Queen, who decks her subjects\\*
With the light of God's own grace.

\end{verse}
