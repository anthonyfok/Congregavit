\FirstLine{Mother of Mercy, day by day}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\FirstVerse{M}{other} of Mercy, day by day \\*
My love of thee grows more and more; \\
Thy gifts are strewn up on my way, \\*
Like sands upon the great seashore. 

\flagverse{2}Though poverty and work and woe \\*
The masters of my life may be, \\
When times are worst, who does not know, \\*
Darkness is light with love of thee? 

\flagverse{3}But scornful men have coldly said \\*
Thy love was leading me from God; \\
And yet in this I did but tread, \\*
The very path my Saviour trod. 

\flagverse{4}Get me the grace to love thee more; \\*
Jesus will give if thou wilt plead; \\
And, Mother, when life's cares are o'er, \\*
Oh, I shall love thee then indeed. 

\end{verse}
