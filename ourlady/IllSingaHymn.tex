\FirstLine{I'll sing a hymn to Mary}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\FirstVerse{I}{'ll} sing a hymn to Mary,\\*
The Mother of my God, \\
The Virgin of all virgins,\\*
Of David's royal blood.\\
O teach me, holy Mary,\\*
A loving song to frame,\\
When wicked men blaspheme thee,\\*
To love and bless thy name.

\flagverse{2} O Lily of the valley,\\*
O Mystic Rose, what tree\\
Or flower e'en the fairest,\\*
Is half so fair as thee?\\
O let me, though so lowly\\*
Recite my Mother's fame\\
When wicked men blaspheme thee,\\*
I'll love and bless thy name.

\end{verse}
