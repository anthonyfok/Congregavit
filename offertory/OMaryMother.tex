\FirstLine{O Mary Mother, sweetest best}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\begin{altverse}
\FirstVerse{O}{ Mary} Mother, sweetest best;\\*
From heaven's immortal bowers.\\
 Do gather for a little child,\\*
 A bouquet of sweet flowers. \\
 I  wish my little heart to be\\*
 A cradle fair and gay, \\
 Where
Blessed Jesus may repose\\* 
 On my First Communion Day.\\
 Where blessed Jesus may repose\\*
 On my First Communion Day.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{2}My little child, I can obtain\\*
 So bright a wreath for
thee. \\
 That Jesus will delight to come,\\*
 Within thy heart to be.\\
 I'll give thee lovely charity\\*
 More warm than roses glow.\\
 I'll give thee heavenly purity\\*
 More white than lily snow\\
 I'll give thee heavenly purity\\*
 More white than lily snow.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{3}  The violet of humility\\*
 Shall yield a sweet perfume\\
 And Jesus will delight to be,\\*
 Within thy little room.\\
 But then remember dearest child,\\*
 The blossoms that I give\\
 Require the wat'ring of a prayer\\*
 Or they will cease to live \\
 Require the wat'ring of a prayer\\*
 Or they will cease to live.
\end{altverse}
 
 \begin{altverse}
 \flagverse{4} Most tender Mother and most dear,\\*
Thou knowest how frail I am,\\
A very giddy, thoughtless thing,\\*
A weak and helpless lamb.\\
But O if thou wilt but send down\\*
Those precious flowers to me,\\
I doubt not but with thy good help\\*
Well watered they will be.
\end{altverse}
 
 \begin{altverse}
\flagverse{5} Then Mary from her holy hands\\*
Those precious flowers sent down,\\
As beautiful and pure as those\\*
That wreathe an angel's crown.\\
That little soul was richly blest\\*
In which dear Jesus lay,\\
Like the sweet turtle in its nest,\\*
That first Communion day.
\end{altverse}
