\FirstLine{When the Patriarch was returning}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\FirstVerse{W}{hen} the Patriarch was returning\\*
Crowned with triumph from the fray,\\
Him the peaceful king of Salem\\*
Came to meet upon his way;\\
Meekly bearing bread and wine,\\*
Holy Priesthood’s aweful sign.

\flagverse{2}On the truth thus dimly shadowed\\*
Later days a luster shed;\\
When the great high-Priest eternal,\\*
Under form of wine and bread,\\
For the world’s immortal food\\*
Gave his flesh and gave his blood.

\flagverse{3}Wondrous Gift! The Word who fashioned\\*
All things by his might divine,\\
Bread into his body changes,\\*
Into his own blood the wine;\\
What though sense no change perceives,\\*
Faith admires, adores, believes.

\flagverse{4}He who once to die a Victim\\*
On the cross did not refuse,\\
Day by day upon our altars,\\*
That same Sacrifice renews;\\
Through his holy priesthood’s hands,\\*
Faithful to his last commands

\flagverse{5}While the people all uniting\\*
In the Sacrifice sublime\\
Offer Christ to his high Father,\\*
Offer up themselves with him;\\
Then together with the priest\\*
On the living Victim feast.

\end{verse}
