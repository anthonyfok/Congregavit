\FirstVerse{A}{lmighty} Father, take this bread,\\
Thy people offer Thee;\\
Where sins divide us, take instead\\
One fold and family.

Christ's blood, redemption's price;\\
Receive it, Holy Trinity,\\
This holy sacrifice.

Thy name be praised on earth;\\
On all men be that peace outpoured\\
Once promised at His birth.
