\FirstLine{Dear St.~Joseph, pure and gentle}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\FirstVerse{D}{ear} St.~Joseph, pure and gentle,\\*
Guardian of the Saviour child,\\
Treading with the virgin mother,\\*
Egypt’s deserts rough and wild.

\flagverse{2}Hail St.~Joseph, spouse of Mary,\\*
Blessed above all saints on high,\\
When the death shades round us gather,\\*
Teach, Oh, teach us how to die.

\flagverse{3}He who rested on thy bosom,\\*
Is by countless saints adored,\\
Prostrate angels in His presence,\\*
Sing Hosannas to their Lord.

\flagverse{4}Now to thee no gift refusing,\\*
Jesus stoops to hear thy prayer,\\
Then, dear saint, from thy fair dwelling,\\*
Give to us a father’s care.

\flagverse{5}Dear St.~Joseph, kind and loving,\\*
Stretch to us a helping hand;\\
Guide us through life's toils and sorrows,\\*
Safely to the distant land.

\flagverse{6}In the strife of life be near us,\\*
And in death, Oh, hover nigh;\\
Let our souls on thy sweet bosom,\\*
To their home of gladness fly.

\end{verse}
