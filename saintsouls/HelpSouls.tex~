\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\begin{altverse}
\FirstVerse{H}{elp,} Lord, the souls that Thou hast made,\\*
 The souls to Thee so dear,\\*
 In prison for the debt unpaid\\*
Of sin committed here.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{2}These holy souls, they suffer on,\\*
Resign'd in heart and will,\\*
Until Thy high behest is done,\\*
And justice has its fill. 
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{3}For daily falls, for pardon'd crime,\\*
Their joy to undergo\\*
The shadow of Thy Cross sublime,\\*
The remnant of Thy woe.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{4} Oh, by their patience of delay,\\*
Their hope amid their pain,\\*
Their sacred zeal to burn away\\*
Disfigurement and stain;
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{5} Oh, by their fire of love, not less\\*
In keeness than the flame:\\*
Oh, by their very helplessness,\\*
Oh, by Thy own great Name: 
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{6} Good Jesu, help! sweet Jesu, aid\\*
The souls to Thee most dear,\\*
In prison for the debt unpaid\\*
Of sins committed here.
\end{altverse}

\end{verse}
