%\initialV{O}{ Mary!} first in all our land\\*
%To be so honoured with the name\\
%Of Saint, for service to the poor\\*
%With joyful love and heart aflame.

\initialV{O}{ Mother} Mary of the Cross\\*
The first Australian saint, we hail.\\
Thy work to lead the poor to truth\\*
Awaking mercy in thy trail.
%By thy example may we learn\\*
%The Love of God will never fail.

%To serve the King who shall prevail.
%The first saint of Australia\\
%Do bless this dry and dusty land\\*
%And make us strong and holier.

% Of all our land of saints the first
% Look down upon our wasted land
% And send down dew to still its thirst

% Our teacher, guide and patroness
% Accept our praise with gloria???

\flagverse{2}To Joseph's aid thou ever turned,\\*
Strong in the faith that he would be\\
%\flagverse{2}Thou trusted in Saint Joseph's care,\\*
%Strong man and silent, he would be\\
An advocate to that dear Heart\\*
That bled and died upon the Tree.

\flagverse{3}The Tree of life, the Cross of death\\*
To which thy name and life were bound,\\
The paradox that pain and strife\\*
To everlasting joy redound.

\flagverse{4}O Mary! intercede for us\\*
And form us to His holy Will\\
With Father and the Holy Ghost\\*
And Heart of Jesus burning still.
%And guide our steps, that this our land\\
%May be God's own from sea to sea\\*
%And yield full fruit beneath His Hand.

\end{verse}
