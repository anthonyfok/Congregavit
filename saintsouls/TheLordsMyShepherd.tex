\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\begin{altverse}
\FirstVerse{T}{he} Lord's my shepherd, I'll not want.\\*
He makes me down to lie\\
In pastures green: He leadeth me \\*
The quiet waters by.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{2}My soul He doth restore again,\\*
And me to walk doth make\\
Within the paths of righteousness,\\*
E'en for His own Name's sake.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{3}Yea, though I walk in death's dark vale,\\*
Yet will I fear none ill:\\
For Thou art with me,\\*
And Thy rod and staff me comfort still.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{4}My table Thou hast furnished\\*
In presence of my foes;\\
My head Thou dost with oil anoint,\\*
And my cup overflows.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{5}Goodness and mercy all my life\\*
Shall surely follow me:\\
And in God's house for evermore\\*
My dwelling-place shall be.

\end{altverse}
