\begin{altverse}
\FirstVerse{N}{earer,} my God, to Thee\\*
Nearer to Thee,\\
E'en though it be a cross\\*
That raiseth me:\\
	Still all my song would be,\\*
	Nearer, my God, to Thee,\\
	Nearer, my God, to Thee,\\*
	Nearer, to Thee.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{2} Friends may depart from me,\\*
Night may come down,\\
Clouds of adversity\\*
Darken and frown:\\
Still through my tears I'll see\\*
Hope gently leading me,\\
Nearer, my God to Thee,\\*
Nearer to Thee.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{3}What though the shadows fall,\\*
Naught shall I fear;\\
When darkest seems the night,\\*
Morning is near,\\
Sweet shall my trusting be,\\*
Sorrow still bringing me\\
Nearer, my God to Thee,\\*
Nearer to Thee.
\end{altverse}
