\initialV{S}{aint} Theresa, flow'r of grace,\\
Hidden save from God thy worth,\\
Turn not from our earnest prayer,\\
Show'r thy roses on the earth,\\
\vin Little Flow'r of God.

On His shoulders thou wert borne,\\
Like and eagle's were His wings,\\
Spread to guard thee night and morn,\\
\vin Little Flow'r of God.

All earth's grief and bitter pain,\\
Save the world and our dear land,\\*
Pray that Christ our King may reign,\\*
