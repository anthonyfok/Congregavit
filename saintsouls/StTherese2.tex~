\HymnTitleInVerse{St.~Thérèse of Lisieux}
\initialV{H}{idden} by Carmel's cloister-wall,\\*
But e'en more ``hid with Christ in God,''\\
Love's victim, who, in giving all,\\*
Her ``Little Way'' unswerving trod.

\flagverse{2}No earthly cloud e'er came between\\*
Teresa and her Only Love,\\
While all unnoticed and unseen,\\*
She lived as angels live above.

\flagverse{3}And still her pray'rs make sick men whole,\\*
To anguish'd minds bring peace and rest---\\
More wondrous still, those heal'd in soul\\*
By thousands ``rise, and call her blest.''

\flagverse{4}Teresa of the Child Divine!\\*
Styl'd ``Saint'' by Holy Church's pow'r,\\
The sacred aureole is thine---\\*
But still thou'rt Jesus' ``Little Flower.''

\end{verse}
