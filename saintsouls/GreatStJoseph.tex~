\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\begin{altverse}
\initialV{G}{reat} Saint Joseph, son of David,\\*
Fosterfather of our Lord,\\
Spouse of Mary, ever virgin,\\*
Keeping o'er them watch and ward:\\
In the stable thou didst guard them\\*
With a father's loving care;\\
Thou by God's command didst save them\\*
From the cruel Herod's snare.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{2}Three long days, in grief, in anguish,\\*
With that mother sweet and mild,\\
Mary Virgin, didst thou wander,\\*
Seeking her beloved Child.\\
In the temple thou didst find Him:\\*
Oh, what joy then filled thy heart!\\
In thy sorrows, in thy gladness,\\*
Grant us, Joseph, to have part.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{3}Clasped in Jesus' arms and Mary's,\\*
When death gently came at last,\\
Thy pure spirit, sweetly sighing,\\*
From its earthly dwelling passed.\\
Dear Saint Joseph, by that passing\\*
May our death be like to thine,\\
And with Jesus, Mary, Joseph,\\*
May our souls forever shine.
\end{altverse}
