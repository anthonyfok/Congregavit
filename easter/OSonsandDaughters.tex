who sat, and spake unto the three,
"Your Lord doth go to Galilee."

That night the apostles met in fear;
amidst them came their Lord most dear,
and said, "My peace be on all here."

On this most holy day of days
to God your hearts and voices raise,
in laud and jubilee and praise.
Alleluia!

Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
