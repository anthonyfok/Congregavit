\begin{altverse}
\FirstVerse{A}{lleluia,} sing to Jesus\\*
His the sceptre, His the throne,\\
Alleluia, His the triumph,\\*
His the victory alone:\\
Hark the songs of peaceful Sion\\*
Thunder like a mighty flood:\\
Jesus, out of every nation,\\*
Hath redeemed us by His Blood.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{2} Alleluia, not as orphans\\*
Are we left in sorrow now;\\
Alleluia He is near us,\\*
Faith believes, nor questions how;\\
Though the cloud from sight received Him\\*
When the forty days were o'er,\\
Shall our hearts forget His promise,\\*
`I am with you evermore'?
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{3} Alleluia, Bread of Angels,\\*
Thou on earth our food, our stay;\\
Alleluia, here the sinful \\*
Flee to Thee from day to day;\\
Intercessor, friend of sinners,\\*
Earth's Redeemer, plead for me,\\
Where the songs of all the sinless \\*
Sweep across the crystal sea.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{4} Alleluia, King eternal,\\*
Thee the Lord of lords we own;\\
Alleluia, born of Mary,\\*
Earth Thy footstool, heaven Thy throne;\\
Thou within the veil hast entered,\\*
Robed in flesh, our great High Priest;\\
Thou on earth both Priest and Victim\\*
In the Eucharistic Feast.
\end{altverse}
