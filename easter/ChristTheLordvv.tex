\FirstLine{Christ the Lord is risen today}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\FirstVerse{C}{hrist} the Lord is risen today; \\*
Christians, haste your vows to pay; \\
Offer ye your praises meet, \\*
At the Paschal Victim's feet. 

\flagverse{2}For the sheep the Lamb hath bled,\\*
Sinless in the sinners' stead. \\
``Christ is risen,'' today we cry;\\*
Now He lives no more to die.

\flagverse{3}Christ, the Victim undefiled,\\*
God and man hath reconciled\\
While in strange and awe-full strife\\*
Met together Death and Life: 

\flagverse{4}Christians, on this happy day\\*
Haste with joy your vows to pay. \\
``Christ is risen,'' today we cry; \\*
Now He lives no more to die. 

\flagverse{5}Christ, who once for sinners bled,\\*
Now the First-born from the dead, \\
Throned in endless might and power, \\*
Lives and reigns forevermore.

\flagverse{6}Hail, eternal Hope on high!\\*
Hail, Thou King of victory! \\
Hail, Thou Prince of Life adored!\\*
Help and save us, gracious Lord. 

\end{verse}
