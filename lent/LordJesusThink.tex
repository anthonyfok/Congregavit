\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\FirstVerse{L}{ord} Jesus, think on me,\\*
And purge away my sin;\\
From earthborn passions set me free,\\*
And make me pure within.

\flagverse{2}Lord Jesus, think on me,\\*
With care and woe oppressed;\\
Let me Thy loving servant be,\\*
And taste Thy promised rest.

\flagverse{3}Lord Jesus, think on me,\\*
Nor let me go astray;\\
Through darkness and perplexity\\*
Point Thou the heavenly way.

\flagverse{4}Lord Jesus, think on me,\\*
That, when the flood is passed,\\
I may th'eternal brightness see,\\*
And share Thy joy at last.

\flagverse{5}Lord Jesus, think on me,\\*
That I may sing above\\
Praise to the Father and to Thee,\\*
And to the Holy Dove.
%To Father, Holy Ghost and Thee\\*
%The songs of praise and love.
