Where true charity and love are, God is dwelling there.

Love of Christ has gathered all of us into one
With joy let us now rejoice and be pleased in Him
Let us fear Him, let us love Him, the living God
And may we love one another with sincere hearts.

As we gather now united all into one
Keep our minds free from division, let us beware
Let evil urges be ended, let trouble cease
And in the midst of us be here, the Christ our God.

Like the blessed up in heaven, let us now see
Thy dear Face in glory shining, O Christ our God
The joy immense and rewarding, both meet and good
Through endless ages of ages, world without end.  Amen.
