\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\FirstVerse{W}{hen} I survey the wondrous Cross\\*
On which the Prince of Glory died,\\
My richest gain I count but loss,\\*
And pour contempt on all my pride.

\flagverse{2}Forbid it, Lord, that I should  boast,\\*
Save in the death of Christ, my God:\\
All the vain things that charm me most,\\*
I sacrifice them to His Blood.

\flagverse{3}See from His head, His hands,  His feet,\\*
Sorrow and love flow mingled  down:\\
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,\\*
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

\flagverse{4}Were the whole realm of   nature mine,\\*
That were an offering far too small;\\
Love so amazing, so divine,\\*
Demands my soul, my life, my all.

\end{verse}

\Hpoet{Isaac Watts}{1674--1748}
