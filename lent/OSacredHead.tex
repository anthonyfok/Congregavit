\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\begin{altverse}
\FirstVerse{O}{ Sacred} Head, surrounded\\*
By crown of piercing thorn!\\
O bleeding head, so wounded,\\*
Reviled and put to scorn!\\
Death's pallid hue comes o'er Thee,\\
The glow of life decays,\\
Yet hosts of heaven adore Thee\\
And tremble as they gaze.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{2}I see Thy strength and vigour,\\*
All fading in the strife,\\
And death with cruel rigour,\\*
Bereaving Thee of life;\\
O agony and dying!\\*
O love to sinners free!\\
Jesus, all grace supplying,\\*
Turn Thou Thy face on me.
\end{altverse}


%\flagverse{3}What Thou, my Lord, hast suffered,\\*
%Was all for sinners' gain;\\
%Mine, mine was the transgression,\\*
%But Thine the deadly pain.\\
%Lo, here I fall, my Saviour!\\*
%'Tis I deserve Thy place;\\
%Look on me with Thy favor,\\*
%Vouchsafe to me Thy grace.

%\flagverse{4}Men mock and taunt and jeer Thee,\\*
%Thou noble countenance,\\
%Though mighty worlds shall fear Thee\\*
%And flee before Thy glance.\\
%How art Thou pale with anguish,\\*
%With sore abuse and scorn!\\
%How doth Thy visage languish\\*
%That once was bright as morn!

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{3} What language shall I borrow\\*
To thank Thee, dearest Friend,\\
For this Thy dying sorrow,\\*
Thy pity without end?\\
O make me Thine forever,\\*
And should I fainting be,\\
Lord, let me never, never\\*
Outlive my love to Thee.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
%This verse by Baker -v
\flagverse{4} In this Thy bitter Passion\\*
%Sweet Jesus, 
Good Shepherd, think of me.\\
With Thy most sweet compassion,\\*
Unworthy though I be:\\
Beneath Thy Cross abiding\\*
Forever would I rest,\\
In Thy dear love confiding,\\*
And with Thy presence blest.
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
\flagverse{5} Be Thou my consolation,\\*
My shield, when I must die;\\
Remind me of Thy Passion\\*
When my last hour draws nigh.\\
Mine eyes shall then behold Thee;\\*
Upon Thy Cross shall dwell,\\
My heart by faith enfold Thee;\\*
Who dieth thus, dies well.
\end{altverse}
