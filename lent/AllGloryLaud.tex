Made sweet hosannas ring.

\flagverse{1}Thou art the King of Israel,\\*
Thou David’s royal Son,\\
Who in the Lord’s Name comest,\\*
The King and Blessèd One.



\flagverse{2}The company of angels\\*
Are praising Thee on High,\\
And mortal men and all things\\*
Created make reply.



\flagverse{3}The people of the Hebrews\\*
With palms before Thee went;\\
Our prayer and praise and anthems\\*
Before Thee we present.



\flagverse{4}To Thee, before Thy passion,\\*
They sang their hymns of praise;\\
To Thee, now high exalted,\\*
Our melody we raise.



\flagverse{5}Thou didst accept their praises;\\*
Accept the prayers we bring,\\
Who in all good delightest,\\*
Thou good and gracious King.
