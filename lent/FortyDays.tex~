\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\FirstVerse{F}{orty} days and forty nights\\
Thou wast fasting in the wild;\\
Forty days and forty nights\\
Tempted, and yet undefiled.


\flagverse{2}Shall not we Thy sorrow share\\*
And from earthly joys abstain,\\
Fasting with unceasing prayer,\\*
Glad with Thee to suffer pain?

\flagverse{3}And if Satan, vexing sore;\\*
Flesh or spirit should assail\\
Thou, his Vanquisher before,\\*
Grant we may not faint or fall!

\flagverse{4}So shall we have peace Divine:\\*
Holier gladness ours shall be;\\
Round us, too, shall angels shine,\\*
Such as ministered to Thee.

\flagverse{5}Keep, O keep us, Saviour dear,\\*
Ever constant by Thy side;\\
That we Thee we may appear\\*
At th' eternal Eastertide.

\end{verse}
