\flagverse{1}By the love of Christ we have been ~ brought together.\\
Let us find in Him our gladness ~ and our pleasure;\\
May we love and revere Him ~ God the living,\\*
And in love respect each other ~ with sincere hearts.

\flagverse{2}So when we as one are gathered ~ all together,\\*
Let us strive to keep our minds free ~ of division;\\
May there be an end to malice, strife and quarrels,\\*
And let Christ our God be dwelling ~ here among us.

\flagverse{3}May Thy face thus be our vision, bright in glory,\\*
Christ our God, with all the blessed ~ Saints in heaven:\\
Such delight is pure and faultless, joy unbounded,\\*
Which endures through countless ages ~ world without end.
Amen.
