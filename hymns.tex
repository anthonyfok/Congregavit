\heading{Prayer after Communion}

I give Thee thanks, O holy Lord, Father almighty, eternal God, who hast vouchsafed, through no merit of mine, but of Thy great mercy alone, to feed me, a sinner, 
%  not for any merits of mine, but solely
%  out of the condescension of Thy mercy, to satisfy me a sinner, 
Thine unworthy servant, with the precious Body and Blood of
  Thy Son our Lord Jesus Christ. 

I pray that this holy Communion be not to me a condemnation unto punishment, but a saving
  plea unto forgiveness. May it be unto me the armour of faith and shield of good will. May it be the emptying out of my
  vices, the extinction of all concupiscence and lust, the increase of charity and patience, of humility and obedience, and    
  of all virtues; a strong defense against the snares of all enemies, visible and invisible; the perfect quieting of all my
  evil impulses, both fleshly and ghostly; a firm cleaving unto Thee, the one true God; and a pledge of a blessed destiny.
  
And I beseech Thee, that Thou wouldst vouchsafe to bring me, a sinner, to that ineffable banquet, where Thou, with Thy Son
  and the Holy Ghost, art to Thy saints true light, fullness of content, eternal joy, gladness without alloy and perfect
  happiness. Through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.
% I give Thee thanks, O holy Lord, Father Almighty, Everlasting God, for having been pleased, through no merit of mine, but of Thy great mercy alone, to feed me, a sinner, and Thy unworthy servant, with the precious Body and Blood of Thy Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. 
%I pray that this Holy Communion may not be for my judgment and condemnation, but for my pardon and salvation. 
%Let this Holy Communion be to me an armor of faith and a shield of good will, a cleansing of all vices, and a rooting out of all evil desires.
%May it increase love and patience, humility and obedience, and all virtues.
%May it be a firm defense against the evil designs of all my visible and invisible enemies, a perfect quieting of all the desires of soul and body.
%May this Holy Communion bring about a perfect union with Thee, the one true God, and at last enable me to reach eternal bliss when Thou wilt call me.
%I pray that Thou bring me, a sinner, to the indescribable Feast where Thou, with Thy Son and the Holy Spirit, are to Thy saints true light, full blessedness, everlasting joy, and perfect happiness.
%Through the same Christ our Lord.
%Amen.
