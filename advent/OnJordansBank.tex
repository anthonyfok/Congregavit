\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\FirstVerse{O}{n} Jordan's bank the Baptist's cry\\*
Announces that the Lord is nigh;\\
Awake and hearken, for he brings\\*
Glad tidings of the King of kings.

\flagverse{2}Then cleansed be every breast from sin;\\*
Make straight the way for God within,\\
Prepare we in our hearts a home\\*
Where such a mighty Guest may come.

\flagverse{3}For Thou art our salvation, Lord,\\*
Our refuge and our great reward;\\
Without Thy grace we waste away\\*
Like flowers that wither and decay.

\flagverse{4}To heal the sick stretch out Thine hand,\\*
And bid the fallen sinner stand;\\
Shine forth and let Thy light restore\\*
Earth's own true loveliness once more.

\flagverse{5}All praise, eternal Son, to Thee,\\*
Whose advent doth Thy people free;\\
Whom with the Father we adore\\*
And Holy Ghost for evermore.

\end{verse}
