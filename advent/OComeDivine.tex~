\FirstLine{O come, divine Messiah"!}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\FirstVerse{O}{ come,} divine Messiah!\\*
The world in silence waits the day\\
When hope shall sing its triumph,\\*
And sadness flee away.

\flagverse{Chorus:} Sweet Saviour, haste;\\*
Come, come to earth;\\
Dispel the night, and show Thy face,\\*
And bid us hail the dawn of grace.\\
O come, divine Messiah,\\*
The world in silence waits the day\\
When hope shall sing its triumph,\\*
And sadness flee away.

\flagverse{2}O thou, whom nations sighed for,\\*
Whom priests and prophets long foretold,\\
Wilt break the captive fetters,\\*
Redeem the long-lost fold.

\flagverse{3}Thou'll come in peace and meekness,\\*
And lowly will thy cradle be;\\
All clothed in human weakness\\*
Shall we thy Godhead see.

\end{verse}
