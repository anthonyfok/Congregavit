\flagverse{Ant}\initialV{D}{rop} down dew, ye heavens, from above, and let the clouds rain the Just One.

\flagverse{1}Be not angry, O Lord, and remember no longer our iniquity :\\
behold the city of thy sanctuary is become a desert, Sion is made a
desert. Jerusalem is desolate,\\
the house of our holiness and of thy glory, where our fathers praised thee.

%Drop down dew, ye heavens, from above, and let the clouds rain the Just One.

\flagverse{2}We have sinned, and we are become as one unclean, and we have all
fallen as a leaf;\\
and our iniquities, like the wind, have
taken us away thou hast hid thy face from us,\\
and hast crushed us by the hand of our iniquity.

\flagverse{3}See, O Lord, the affliction of thy people, and send him whom thou hast
promised to send.\\
Send forth the Lamb, the ruler of the
earth, from the rock of the desert to the mount of the daughter of
Sion,\\
that he himself may take off the yoke of our
captivity.

\flagverse{4}Be comforted, be comforted, my people; thy salvation shall speedily
come.\\
Why wilt thou waste away in sadness? why hath sorrow
seized thee?\\
I will save thee; fear not:\\
for I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Redeemer.
